## Tasks

* Create an AWS account and protect the root user with MFA https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa

* Create an EC2 instance, connect to it through SSH and install apache or nginx manually, terminate it then. 

* Create an EC2 instance, provision software (apache/nginx) using Cloudformation, validate the installation, finally delete the stack. 
  Provide the resulting template as outcome of this task.

* (*) Given that we have a properly written Cloudformation template come up with an idea how we 
  can create and update a cloudformation stack based on this template automatically. Try to implement it.
