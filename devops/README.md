## How to pass the testing tasks
Inside each folder there are tasks and questions, please complete tasks in ascending order.

Tasks with ' * ' can be skipped if they seem too difficult.

Results must be uploaded via pull-request.

For theoretical questions please fill answers right after the questions in an appropriate README.md file.

For practice tasks, fill in the results as you wish =)
